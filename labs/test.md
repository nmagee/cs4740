# This is just a test

Here we go with some content. Does it work?

- bullet 1
- bullet 2
- another bullet

But we can also make numbered lists!

1. This is just an item.
1. But this is another.
3. Here we go!

But can we also do code blocks?

    import boto3
    
    function do_this():
      print("Here we are. Imagine that.")
