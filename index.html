<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course Description</h3>
<p>This course investigates the architectural foundations of the various cloud platforms and examines both current cloud computing platforms and modern cloud research. Student assignments utilize the major cloud platforms. Prerequisite: CS 2150 with grade of C- or higher.</p>
<p>Cloud Computing has become an everyday term, but its meaning often remains unclear. For the purposes of this course, "cloud computing" makes up a specific way of creating, managing, and interacting with remote computing infrastructure and services, so-called IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).</p>
<p>We will discuss the technical, business, and practical reasons that cloud computing emerged, and the ways it has evolved in the last 15 years. Attention will be paid to the ways cloud computing - by empowering users to create and use infrastructure on demand and at scale - places additional risks and requirements upon the user, such as cost, security, and operational viability.</p>

  <h4 style="font-size:120%;">Fall 2020 - This course will be held entirely online</h4>
  <p>This course is being offered both <strong>ASYNCHRONOUSLY</strong> and <strong>SYNCHRONOUSLY</strong> in a flipped mode. Most lectures will be video streams to be watched or re-watched whenever the student chooses.
  Class discussion, more specifics of the content, and Q&A will be held in <strong>REAL-TIME each Thursday from 2:00-3:00pm EDT</strong>. Students will be expected to attend these discussions having viewed the lectures and completed all reading and external video assignments beforehand.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Audience</h3>
<p>This course will emphasize hands-on experience in the creation, management, and consumption of cloud-based services. For the purposes of getting started I will assume that you fit roughly into at least one of three categories as you approach the subject:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Developer</li>
  <li>Sysadmin / Systems Engineer</li>
  <li>Data Scientist / Researcher</li>
</ol>
<p>Students will learn how to create cloud resources according to best practices, with an emphasis upon creating reusable snippets of infrastructure-as-code.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Student Survey</b> - a simple questionnaire for me to ascertain baseline skills for the class and students' familiarity with a variety of tools and concepts.
  <li><b>Lectures / Reading / Viewing</b> - Posted beforehand. Though not a graded portion of the course, lectures, readings and supporting videos have been carefully selected to introduce and explain important concepts to you. Should you not digest these you will likely not perform well in the course. Lectures and all links will remain posted for the entire semester.
  <li><b>Labs</b> - Posted beforehand. Labs are an important way for you to interact with an actual public cloud provider. In most cases this will be Amazon Web Services. Labs will either be hosted in Qwiklabs (and incur no charges in your own AWS account) or are designed to cost very little if performed in your account (a couple of dollars at most).
  <li><b>Discussions</b> - Class discussions are the only synchronous element of this course, and will be held weekly on Thursdays at 2pm Eastern Time. Please join the discord channel and bring your questions! Discussion may be accompanied by live Twitch streams.
  <li><b>Programming Assignments</b> - Programming assignments are graded mini-projects that implement your understanding of course material. PAs will be posted one week before due. There is no time limit on PAs but they must be completed alone, without support of other students or outsiders. Given the full week allowed to work on these assignments, late work will not be accepted.
  <li><b>Mid-term Exam</b> - A mid-term exam will be given in October to track your understanding and retention of course material. This will be posted in Collab one week before due, but you will only be allowed 2 hours to complete it once you begin.
  <li><b>Final Exam</b> - A final exam will be given in December to track your understanding and retention of coursre material. This will be posted in Collab one week before due, but you will only be allowed 2 hours to complete it once you begin.

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tools</h3>
<p>Students in this course will be expected to use the following pieces of software on a weekly basis:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="">YouTube</a></strong> - This will be our primary platform for recorded lectures and the video portion of real-time discussions.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://discord.com/new/download">Discord</a></strong> - Discord will serve as our hub for discussions, Q&A, and distributing extra material specific to topics or assignments. Download the software, create a Discord account, and <strong><a href="https://l.uvarc.io/discord">join the class server</a></strong>.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/">Git/GitHub</a></strong> - Students are expected to know how to version control their material using Git. Some programming assignments will require submission via commits pushed to GitHub. If you do not have a GitHub account, create one now.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://nmagee.github.io/cs4740/aws/">Amazon Web Services</a></strong> - All students will use AWS accounts and credits for this course. Please click the link to learn more about the AWS Educate program and your options for creating an account. We will also be using the <strong>AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">CLI</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/">SDKs</a></strong> to interact with the AWS cloud programmatically. This will include the CLI interface and at least one SDK, preferably the <code>boto3</code> library for Python.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a></strong> - You will need the Docker CE or Docker Desktop application for some portions of this course. All students should also create an account on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>. Students may also have practice assignments using the <strong><a href="https://training.play-with-docker.com/" target="_new">Play With Docker</a></strong> sandbox.
  <li><strong><a href="https://amazon.qwiklabs.com/">Qwiklabs</a></strong> - Provides hands-on labs in AWS services. Many of these are free and include detailed steps to complete practice projects of varying complexity.
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="authors" class="anchor" href="#authors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Honor Policy</h3>
<p>The course will be conducted according to the UVA honor system. Programming assignments and exams are to be completed by the individual (no group collaborations). You will sign an honor pledge for all assignments, quizzes, and exams; more importantly, I expect you to adhere to the intent of the pledge. Cooperative efforts at understanding the material and technologies of the course are encouraged.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors" class="anchor" href="#authors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Details</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Students are expected to complete every reading and watch every lecture. Failure to do so will undoubtedly leave gaps in your understanding of the subject, and the specifics required for assignments and exams.</li>
  <li>You should never wait until the last minute to work on any aspect of this class. Computers and software can crash, and websites can have temporary outages. Keep close to the class schedule for readings, lectures, and assignments.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Support or Contact</h3>
<p>If you have a question about any aspect of this course - a particular topic, method, concept, etc. - please contact the TAs or me via Discord or email. It is often the case that you're not the only one having trouble understanding it!</p>
