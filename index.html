    <h3 style="font-size:120%;">Enrollment & Waitlist</h3>
    <p>As course registration begins I am often flooded with requests to help enroll in this course, or for more information about the section size and waitlist.
      While I read each email I am unable to reply to them all due to the sheer volume I receive. So here is some general information I would offer in my reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      For lots of reasons this elective course is of great interest to students as they prepare for interviews, graduation, and work in the profession after UVA.
      Given that CS majors and fourth-years are given the first opportunity to enroll, all sections of CS4740 tend to fill up quickly. If you are placed on the waitlist,
      there is still a chance you may be added. Most semesters the first 20-40 students on the waitlist are admitted. There is also
      the possibility that, given a deep waitlist, the department change our classroom assignment to accommodate more students. But only if classroom space allows for that.
      (In Fall 2021 enrollment was expanded from 80 to 120 for this reason.) However, both the department chair and the dean's office have urged instructors not 
      to circumvent the waitlist by adding students manually - it only invites confusion or a sense of unfairness.

<h2><a id="description" class="anchor" href="#description" name="description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course investigates the architectural foundations of the various cloud platforms and examines both current cloud computing platforms and modern cloud research. Student assignments utilize the major cloud platforms. Prerequisite: CS 2150 with grade of C- or higher.</p>
<p>Cloud Computing has become an everyday term, but its meaning often remains unclear - it could mean Dropbox, Gmail, iCloud, Heroku, Carbonite, etc. For the purposes of this course, "cloud computing" makes up a specific way of creating, managing, and interacting with publicly-accessible, API-driven, computing infrastructure and services, so-called IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).</p>
<p>We will discuss the technical, business, and practical reasons that cloud computing emerged, and the ways it has evolved in the last 15 years. Attention will be paid to the ways cloud computing - by empowering users to create and use infrastructure on demand and at scale - places additional risks and requirements upon the user, such as cost, security, and operational viability.</p>

<h2><a id="audience" class="anchor" href="#audience" name="audience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Audience</h2>
<p>This course will emphasize hands-on experience in the creation, management, and consumption of cloud-based services. For the purposes of getting started I will assume that you fit roughly into at least one of three categories as you approach the subject:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Developer</li>
    <li>Systems Administrator / Systems Engineer</li>
    <li>Data Scientist / Researcher</li>
  </ol>
<p>While some students often have some experience working in the cloud through projects or internships, we will make no assumptions about any previous experience with cloud concepts or services. Students of this course will learn how to create dynamic, secure, cloud resources according to best practices, with an emphasis upon creating reusable snippets of infrastructure-as-code.</p>

<h2>Course Elements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Student Survey</b> - a simple questionnaire to help ascertain baseline skills for the class and students' familiarity with a variety of tools and concepts. Submit the survey <a href="https://l.uvarc.io/f22-survey" target="_new">here</a>.
  <li><b>Readings / External Resources</b> - Though not a graded portion of the course, readings and supporting material have been carefully selected to introduce and explain important concepts to you. Digest these before class each week.
  <li><b>Labs</b> - All required labs (numbered 1-10 in the schedule) must be completed as they map to the curriculum. Additional labs are entirely optional. Hands-on labs are an important way for you to interact with an actual public cloud provider. Labs will either be hosted in Qwiklabs (run within a student account in AWS) or designed to cost very little if completed in your account (a couple of dollars at most).
  <li><b>Programming Assignments</b> - Programming assignments are graded mini-projects that implement your understanding of course material within an actual solution. PAs will be posted one week before due. There is no time limit on PAs but they must be completed alone, without support of other students or outsiders. Late work will not be accepted.
  <li><b>Mid-term / Final Exams</b> - Exams will be given to track your understanding and retention of course material. Exams will be posted in Collab one week before due, but you will only be allowed 2 hours to complete once you begin.
</ul>

<h3><a id="honor" href="#honor" class="anchor" name="honor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Honor Policy</h3>
<p>The course will be conducted according to the UVA honor system. Programming assignments and exams are to be completed by the individual (no group collaborations). You will sign an honor pledge for all assignments, quizzes, and exams; more importantly, I expect you to adhere to the intent of the pledge. Cooperative efforts at understanding the material and technologies of the course are encouraged.</p>
<p>All suspected violations will be forwarded to the Honor Committee, and you may, at my discretion, receive an immediate zero on that assignment regardless of any action taken by the Honor Committee.</p>
<p>If you believe you may have committed an Honor Offense, you may wish to file a Conscientious Retraction by calling the Honor Offices at (434)924-7602. For your retraction to be considered valid, it must, among other things, be filed with the Honor Committee before you are aware that the act in question has come under suspicion by anyone. More information can be found at <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/" target=_new">http://honor.virginia.edu</a>. Your Honor representatives can be found at: <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/representatives" target="_new">http://honor.virginia.edu/representatives</a>.</p>
